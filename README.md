# SIngleProduct

in >src  you can find my backend made with Spring

in >client you can find my frontend made with React, it need - npm start - to run 

In order to interact with the client for example view Product Description, Add to Cart , view the Cart  , Subscribe to newsletter 
You need to: 

Add project as Maven

Add Configuration Application

resources > application.properties > set your datasource username and password

Create manually Database named Final Project in prosgresql

Run the application ( the database will be populated with Entity ) 

Add records, you can find the Inserts in - db.sql - file in properties

....

The AddtoCart() has a problem, the private keys will be saved as null when making the request,

I'm working to fix it
